### Description
This Unity project contains scripts and shaders that I commonly use in Unity. Because I am getting tired of rewriting (and/or copy pasting) these same scripts over and over again, I decided to gather and put them in a repository that I can use as a submodule for future projects.

This is currently a work in progress.

### Documentation
Documentation is not available yet, but example scenes are included in the repository.

### Usage
If you are using Git to manage your Unity Project, you can include this repository as a submodule by using this command:

    git submodule add https://github.com/Gkxd/UsefulThings.git
    
This will place the repository in the *current directory*.
